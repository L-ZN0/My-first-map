## What did I build?

["My First Map" App](l-zn0.github.io/My-first-map/)  is a one-web app that is a interactive maps which shows the three activities that I did in my vacation.

Users can...
1. **Toggle through the map and points** by scrolling on the map and selecting the red buttons on the map or clicking on them specifically. 
2. **Explore each map** by using gestures to zoom in/out anywhere or rotate the map orientation

## Why did I build this?
I've decided to build this because I've wanted to show what I was doing in my vacation. The 3 locations give a brief summary on what I would do for the 2 months.

## Tech stack

To build this app, I used these tools:

1. [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), for generating the corndinates
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) free IDE, with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extensions.
3. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), for publishing the app for free!

## Feature Spotlight

One key feature I want to spotlight is the addition of the cordinates.

When doing this you have to use two apps, Google maps and the Visual code itself. When doing this what is basically done is,find the cordanates and placing them to the code. From the three locations you would have to create three different lines of code which all are seperated form one another. When completed the lines it would tell the map all the three locations at once and mark them with the red dot.
